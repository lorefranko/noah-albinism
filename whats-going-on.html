				<h3>Michael J. McGowan Leadership Scholarship Award</h3>
					<p>The Michael J. McGowan Leadership Scholarship Award was established in 2008 on behalf of the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) to recognize leadership and empower young people with albinism
					</p>
				</br>
					<p>NOAH will award one scholarship annually to a NOAH member residing in the U.S. or Canada with albinism enrolled in an undergraduate program at an institution of higher education in the U.S. or Canada. The intent is to enhance educational opportunities for students with albinism while celebrating dedication and outstanding leadership qualities similar to those exhibited by NOAH’s current and past leaders. The 2012 scholarship award will be $3,000.
					See the 2012 McGowan Leadership Scholarship application for more information. Application materials for the 2012 McGowan Scholarship must be received by May 01, 2012. To Apply complete this form and submit required materials.

				</br>
					<p>Love your low vision optometrist? Overjoyed with your ophthalmologist? Indebted to your dermatologist? NOAH wants to hear about it!
					One of the most common requests made of NOAH is to provide the name of a doctor experienced in treating patients with albinism. In response to that request, with your help, NOAH is starting a “Recommended by a Friend Resource List” of medical professionals experienced in treating patients with albinism, so that NOAH will be able to provide an answer when asked that important question.
					Contribute to this list by using the Medical Professional Survey tool on our website at <a href="http://www.albinism.org/RecommendADoc.html">www.albinism.org/RecommendADoc.html</a>.
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>Our friends in the larger albinism community will greatly benefit from your recommendation. To recommend more than one professional, please complete the survey multiple times (one for each professional).
					If you have any questions about the resource list or the online survey tool, please contact Lori at <a href="mailto:info@albinism.org" itempromp="email">info@albinism.org</a>.
					Thank you in advance for sharing this important information with the greater albinism community.

			<h2>Parent Connections</h2>

			<h3>Limited Spaces Available!</h3>
			<br/>

			<p>Don't take our word for it! Here's what participants have to say about "Parent Connections" 

			"I appreciate the outlet to vent and share my experience of having two children with albinism. I feel very fortunate to be a part of this group. It has been amazing to have guests give insight to the various situations my children are faced with on a daily basis. "

			"The calls have been a really supportive experience. It's nice to hear other people’s stories who are going through a similar issue. The guest callers are informative and that gives me a head start on what to expect as my child grows. It's also a great outlet reminding me to nurture and take care of myself so I'm able to truly take care of my son." 

			"It’s an opportunity for parents to share thoughts, ask questions, provide resources for each other, and describe the struggles and triumphs experienced by our children and ourselves. Because everyone already understands the condition, a deeper level of conversation can be reached."
			</p>
			<br/>

			<h2>About Parent Connections</h2>

			<p>NOAH, in partnership with Lighthouse Guild International, has developed a parent support teleconference program as another way to bring the albinism community together. Parent Connections is an opportunity to talk with others who understand what you are going through as a parent of a child with albinism. Get the support you need to be a healthy, informed parent, and build connections in the albinism community – all in the comfort of your own home.
