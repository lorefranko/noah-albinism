			<li><h3>Michael J. McGowan Leadership Scholarship Award</h3></li>
				<p>The Michael J. McGowan Leadership Scholarship Award was established in 2008 on behalf of the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) to recognize leadership and empower young people with albinism. NOAH will award one scholarship annually to a NOAH member residing in the U.S. or Canada with albinism enrolled in an undergraduate program at an institution of higher education in the U.S. or Canada. The intent is to enhance educational opportunities for students with albinism while celebrating dedication and outstanding leadership qualities similar to those exhibited by NOAH’s current and past leaders. The 2012 scholarship award will be $3,000.
				See the 2012 McGowan Leadership Scholarship application for more information. Application materials for the 2012 McGowan Scholarship must be received by May 01, 2012. To Apply complete this form and submit required materials.

				<p>Love your low vision optometrist? Overjoyed with your ophthalmologist? Indebted to your dermatologist? NOAH wants to hear about it!
				One of the most common requests made of NOAH is to provide the name of a doctor experienced in treating patients with albinism. In response to that request, with your help, NOAH is starting a “Recommended by a Friend Resource List” of medical professionals experienced in treating patients with albinism, so that NOAH will be able to provide an answer when asked that important question.
				Contribute to this list by using the Medical Professional Survey tool on our website at <a href="http://www.albinism.org/RecommendADoc.html">www.albinism.org/RecommendADoc.html</a>.</p>
				<p>Our friends in the larger albinism community will greatly benefit from your recommendation. To recommend more than one professional, please complete the survey multiple times (one for each professional).
				If you have any questions about the resource list or the online survey tool, please contact Lori at <a href="mailto:info@albinism.org" itempromp="email">info@albinism.org</a>.
				Thank you in advance for sharing this important information with the greater albinism community.</p>
