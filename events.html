Don't take our word for it! Here's what participants have to say about "Parent Connections" 

"I appreciate the outlet to vent and share my experience of having two children with albinism. I feel very fortunate to be a part of this group. It has been amazing to have guests give insight to the various situations my children are faced with on a daily basis. "

"The calls have been a really supportive experience. It's nice to hear other people’s stories who are going through a similar issue. The guest callers are informative and that gives me a head start on what to expect as my child grows. It's also a great outlet reminding me to nurture and take care of myself so I'm able to truly take care of my son." 

"It’s an opportunity for parents to share thoughts, ask questions, provide resources for each other, and describe the struggles and triumphs experienced by our children and ourselves. Because everyone already understands the condition, a deeper level of conversation can be reached."

About Parent Connections
NOAH, in partnership with Lighthouse Guild International, has developed a parent support teleconference program as another way to bring the albinism community together. Parent Connections is an opportunity to talk with others who understand what you are going through as a parent of a child with albinism. Get the support you need to be a healthy, informed parent, and build connections in the albinism community – all in the comfort of your own home. 

The teleconferences consist of a limited number of parents to provide a safe and comfortable environment for you to voice concerns, ask questions, and share your experiences. Two groups meet for one hour twice a month; one in the evenings and the other at midday. Both are facilitated by a licensed professional and feature presentations from professionals on raising children with albinism.
