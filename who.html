			<h1>What we do</h1>
						<p>Through its advocacy efforts, publications and events, NOAH offers information and support to people with albinism, their families and the professionals who work with them.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Albinism is a genetic condition that results in individuals having little or no pigment in their eyes, skin, or hair. They have inherited altered genes that do not make the usual amounts of a pigment called melanin. One person in 17,000 in the United States has some type of albinism.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Albinism affects people from all races. Most children with albinism are born to parents who have normal hair and eye color for their ethnic backgrounds. A common myth is that people with albinism have red eyes. In fact there are different types of albinism and the amount of pigment in the eyes varies. Although some individuals with albinism have reddish or violet eyes, most have blue eyes. Some have hazel or brown eyes. However, all forms of albinism are associated with uncorrectable vision problems.
