  <h1>NOAH WHO WE ARE</h1>
		<p>NOAH is a U.S. based nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that offers information and support to people with albinism, their families and the professionals who work with them. NOAH is operated by its members on a volunteer basis and is funded primarily by dues and contributions of its members. NOAH has also received grants from foundations and organizations for specific projects.
		NOAH’s board of directors and many members are involved with specific committees and projects that address a wide variety of issues relevant to the albinism community.  Committees include advocacy, NOAH’s biannual conference, financial development, albinism awareness, and editorial.  For more information about these or other endeavors that you might be interested in getting involved with, please email info@albinism.org.
