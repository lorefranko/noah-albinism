<h1>Fundraising</h1>

<p>Fundraising
In addition to year-round fundraising efforts, NOAH members across North America participate in annual bowl-a-thons to raise money for the organization. In 2009, NOAH's bowl-a-thon efforts collectively raised over $60,000 that will help the organization to grow and expand its services to individuals and families. in addition to providing wonderful opportunities for fellowship amongst the albinism community, volunteers play an active part in supporting the organization through grassroots organizing.</P>
